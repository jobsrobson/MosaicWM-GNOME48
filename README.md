> [!NOTE]
> ## GNOME 48 compatibility fork
>
> This repository is a fork of [CleoMenezesJr/MosaicWM](https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/MosaicWM), based on upstream commit [`16f14d3`](https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/MosaicWM/commit/16f14d3f5a1eac6ae87fc935d681afb91d6c21e0).
>
> The purpose of this fork is to bring the current MosaicWM experience, including miniatures, to **GNOME Shell 48 / Mutter 48**, while retaining compatibility with GNOME Shell 50.
>
> ### Changes in this fork
>
> - **GNOME Shell 48 support**
>   - Adds GNOME Shell 48 to the supported Shell versions.
>   - Introduces a compatibility layer for Mutter APIs unavailable in Mutter 48.
>   - Falls back to `maximized_horizontally` and `maximized_vertically` when `Meta.Window.is_maximized()` is unavailable.
>   - Preserves the native `is_maximized()` implementation on newer Mutter versions when available.
>
> - **Configurable bottom reserved space**
>   - Adds an optional reserved area below Mosaic-managed windows.
>   - Useful with docks that overlay windows instead of reserving Mutter work area, such as Dash to Dock with certain configurations.
>   - Configurable from **0 to 300 px**.
>   - Default: **80 px**.
>   - The reserved area is consistently applied to Mosaic tiling, dragging, resizing, swapping, reordering, edge tiling and Overview calculations.
>
> - **Optional panel indicator**
>   - Adds a preference to hide the Mosaic status indicator from the GNOME top panel.
>   - The Mosaic toggle and workspace controls remain available in Quick Settings.
>   - Changes are applied immediately without restarting GNOME Shell.
>
> - **Native preferences window**
>   - Adds a GNOME/Libadwaita preferences window.
>   - Currently provides:
>     - Bottom reserved space
>     - Show panel indicator
>
> ### Tested environment
>
> This fork has been tested on:
>
> - GNOME Shell 48
> - Mutter 48
> - X11
>
> Core MosaicWM functionality, including automatic tiling, smart resizing, miniatures, Overview integration, workspace switching, edge tiling and session restart/login, has been tested successfully.
>
> ### Upstream
>
> MosaicWM is originally developed by the amazing **Cleo Menezes Jr.**
>
> All original project credit belongs to the upstream author and contributors. This fork contains compatibility and configuration changes on top of the original project.
>
> For the original project, documentation and latest upstream development, please see [CleoMenezesJr/MosaicWM](https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/MosaicWM).

A GNOME Shell extension that tiles windows automatically in a mosaic layout.

It is also a testbed. The point is not to maintain an extension indefinitely, but to work out what mosaic tiling should actually do in daily use, in enough detail that the model can be proposed to Mutter and GNOME Shell. An extension is the fastest way to put the idea in front of real users and find out where it falls apart.

## Project status

Early, and moving fast. Behaviour changes between commits, and something that worked last week may not work today.

- Requires **GNOME Shell 50**. Earlier versions are not supported.
- Wayland is the target session.
- Code contributions are unlikely to be accepted right now. See [Contributing](#contributing).

## Design goals

The starting point is Tobias Bernard's [Rethinking Window Management](https://blogs.gnome.org/tbernard/2023/07/26/rethinking-window-management/). That post is the premise, not the specification. It describes the shape of the idea; this project is where the idea meets actual use, and where usability testing gets to overrule the original sketch.

Two places the design has already been pushed further than the post:

- **Miniatures are first-class members of the mosaic.** When a workspace fills up, the least recently used window shrinks into a small live thumbnail and stays on screen, clickable, instead of being exiled to another workspace. Overflow to a new workspace is the fallback, not the first move.
- **Quarter tiling as a general region model.** Halves and quarters are not special cases bolted onto the mosaic; they are regions the mosaic packs into. This is also the part most likely to be useful upstream, independent of the rest.

The consistent principle behind both: nothing should require the user to think about window management. If a behaviour needs explaining before it makes sense, that is a defect in the behaviour, not a gap in the documentation.

## Features

- Automatic mosaic layout using a radial packing algorithm
- Miniature thumbnails when a workspace runs out of room, in most-recently-used order; click one to restore it
- Overflow to another workspace for windows that cannot shrink any further
- Edge tiling to halves and quarters by dragging to a screen edge, with the remaining windows adapting to what is left
- Window swapping by dragging one window onto another, or by keyboard shortcut
- Dedicated workspaces for maximized and fullscreen windows
- Windows grow back toward their preferred size when neighbours close or miniaturize
- Quick Settings toggles for mosaic per workspace and globally, with a top bar indicator
- Miniatures keep their scale and position across the Overview

## Known limitations

- **Touch drag does not tile.** Mutter does not expose the drag position to extensions, so the extension cannot tell where your finger is. It currently detects touch drags and skips edge tiling rather than guessing wrong. Fixing it properly needs a small addition to Mutter.
- **Multi-monitor needs a specific setting.** It requires *Workspaces on all displays* (Settings → Multitasking). *Workspaces on primary display only* is not supported yet ([#30](https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/MosaicWM/issues/30)).
- **No preferences UI.** Keyboard shortcuts can only be changed with `gsettings`. Quick Settings covers the mosaic toggles and nothing else. This is deliberate for now, see below.
- Drag and drop inside the Overview has rough edges.
- The edge tiling overflow preview is not animated.

## Where this is going

Roughly in priority order.

1. **Getting the default behaviour right, before adding any preferences.** A preference added too early freezes a decision that was never validated, and turns a design question into a support burden. Which knobs deserve to exist is something the testing should tell us, not something to guess at up front.
2. **Real multi-monitor support**, including *Workspaces on primary display only*, so the feature can stop being labelled experimental.
3. **Touch support**, which needs a small addition to Mutter: a way for extensions to read the position of an in-progress window drag. Mutter already tracks the number internally; it just is not reachable from JavaScript.
4. **The region model in Mutter, and the mosaic itself in GNOME Shell.** This is the actual destination. The extension exists to make the case with something people have used.
5. **Preferences in GNOME Settings**, not in an extension preferences window, and only after point 1.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CleoMenezesJr/MosaicWM.git
cd MosaicWM
./scripts/build.sh -i
```

Then log out, log back in, and enable it:

```bash
gnome-extensions enable mosaicwm@cleomenezesjr.github.io
```

For everyday use rather than development, set `const DEBUG = false;` in `extension/logger.js` before installing. It defaults to `true`, which logs verbosely and costs CPU.

## Usage

There is nothing to configure. Once enabled:

- Opening a window tiles it into the mosaic.
- Dragging a window reorders it, or tiles it to a half or quarter if you drag to an edge.
- Dragging a window onto another swaps the two.
- Maximizing or going fullscreen moves the window to its own workspace.
- Minimizing takes a window out of the mosaic.
- When the workspace is full, the least recently used window becomes a thumbnail. Click it to bring it back.

## Development

```bash
npm install            # the pre-commit hook shells out to npx eslint
./scripts/setup-hooks  # symlinks .git/hooks/pre-commit, per clone
```

`setup-hooks` has to be run by hand after cloning: git hooks live outside the working tree and are not cloned. The hook only runs ESLint over staged files, while CI runs ESLint over all of `extension/`, plus `shexli` and a build. Passing the hook does not mean CI will pass; CI is the real gate.

```bash
./scripts/build.sh -b        # build only
./scripts/build.sh -i        # build and install
./scripts/run-gnome-shell.sh # nested GNOME Shell session for testing
npm run lint
```

Keep `DEBUG = true` in `extension/logger.js` while developing. Logs go to the journal:

```bash
journalctl -f -o cat /usr/bin/gnome-shell | grep -i mosaic
```

Looking Glass (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd> → `lg`) shows extension errors under its Extensions tab. The [GJS debugging guide](https://gjs.guide/extensions/development/debugging.html) covers the rest.

## Contributing

Most pull requests will be turned down right now. The internals get rewritten often enough that a patch can collide with a refactor before anyone reviews it, and declining good work for that reason wastes your time and mine. Something small and self-contained can still land, so open an issue and ask before writing it. This gets easier once the architecture settles.

What genuinely helps in the meantime:

- **Testing.** Use it as your daily driver and push on the edge cases. This is the single most useful thing anyone can do, given the whole point is finding out where the design breaks under real use.
- **Bug reports** with reproduction steps, your GNOME Shell version, and your monitor setup.
- **Design feedback.** Disagreement about how a behaviour *should* work is more valuable here than a patch that implements it.

Anything that does eventually land must satisfy the [GNOME Shell Extensions Review Guidelines](https://gjs.guide/extensions/review-guidelines.html).

## Support

This is unfunded work on a problem that will take a long time to finish properly. If you would like it to keep going, sponsorship is what makes the time available:
